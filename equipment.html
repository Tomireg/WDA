                <h2>Longsword</h2>
                <p>A longsword is any sword that is generally wielded with two hands.
                    A defining characteristic of the sword is the length of the handle. The hilts range from 8 to 16
                    inches long
                    to provide room for gauntleted hands.
                    Most long swords were double edged.
                    The weapon was designed for utility, the whole sword from the pommel to the tip must be useful in
                    combat.
                    While the designs vary in ornamentation over the 350 years it was used, it carried much of the same
                    look
                    through the period.
                    Compared to the Asian Katana, longswords greatly differ. The hilt is longer, there is a cross guard,
                    the
                    overall weight is much heavier and the blades were straight.

                <h2>Shields</h2>
                <p>A shield is a broad piece of metal or another suitable material, held by straps or a handle attached
                    on one
                    side, used as a protection against blows or missiles.
                    Shields can be put into three categories, small, medium and large. These categories represent the
                    function
                    of the shield.
                    Small shields, for instance, such as bucklers or hungarian punch shields doubled as weapons.
                    They provided minimal defense and moderate level of additional offense. They had to be used
                    strategically
                    and with a great amount of skill. The buckler for example, is a small round shield typically 16
                    inches or less in diameter that is made out of metal.
                    It provides a moderate level of defense and the ability to use the shield as an offensive weapon.

                <h2>Armour</h2>
                <p>The armour consists of multiple layers of protection. The gambeson for instance is a padded defensive
                    jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour.
                    Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting that produced a padded cloth. The
                    full armour is a historically acurate plate armour covering most parts of the body. Includes a
                    helmet, chestplate, arm and leg plates and various other pieces usually crafted from steel.
