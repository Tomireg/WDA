                    <h2>Longsword</h2>
                    <p>A longsword is any sword that is generally wielded with two hands.
                        A defining characteristic of the sword is the length of the handle. The hilts range from 8 to 16
                        inches long
                        to provide room for gauntleted hands.
                        Most long swords were double edged.
                        The weapon was designed for utility, the whole sword from the pommel to the tip must be useful
                        in
                        combat.
                        While the designs vary in ornamentation over the 350 years it was used, it carried much of the
                        same
                        look
                        through the period.
                        Compared to the Asian Katana, longswords greatly differ. The hilt is longer, there is a cross
                        guard,
                        the
                        overall weight is much heavier and the blades were straight.

                    <h2>Shields</h2>
                    <p>A shield is a broad piece of metal or another suitable material, held by straps or a handle
                        attached
                        on one
                        side, used as a protection against blows or missiles.
                        Shields can be put into three categories, small, medium and large. These categories represent
                        the
                        function
                        of the shield.
                        Small shields, for instance, such as bucklers or hungarian punch shields doubled as weapons.
                        They provided minimal defense and moderate level of additional offense. They had to be used
                        strategically
                        and with a great amount of skill. The buckler for example, is a small round shield typically 16
                        inches or less in diameter that is made out of metal.
                        It provides a moderate level of defense and the ability to use the shield as an offensive
                        weapon.

                    <h2>Armour</h2>
                    <p>The armour consists of multiple layers of protection. The gambeson for instance is a padded
                        defensive
                        jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour.
                        Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting that produced a padded cloth.
                        The
                        full armour is a historically acurate plate armour covering most parts of the body. Includes a
                        helmet, chestplate, arm and leg plates and various other pieces usually crafted from steel.
