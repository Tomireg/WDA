<p>Here are some of the most commonly used equipments in Buhurt</p>
<p>Longsword</p>
<p>A longsword is any sword that is generally wielded with two hands. 
    A defining characteristic of the sword is the length of the handle. The hilts range from 8 to 16 inches long to provide room for gauntleted hands.
    Most long swords were double edged. 
    The weapon was designed for utility, the whole sword from the pommel to the tip must be useful in combat. 
    While the designs vary in ornamentation over the 350 years it was used, it carried much of the same look through the period. 
    Compared to the Asian Katana, longswords greatly differ. The hilt is longer, there is a cross guard, the overall weight is much heavier and the blades were straight.

    <p>Shields</p>
    <p>A shield is a broad piece of metal or another suitable material, held by straps or a handle attached on one side, used as a protection against blows or missiles. 
        Shields can be put into three categories, small, medium and large. These categories represent the function of the shield. 
        Small shields, for instance, such as bucklers or hungarian punch shields doubled as weapons. 
        They provided minimal defense and moderate level of additional offense. They had to be used strategically and with a great amount of skill.</p>
        <p>Buckler</p>
        <p>The buckler is a small round shield typically 16 inches or less in diameter that is made out of metal. 
            It provides a moderate level of defense and the ability to use the shield as an offensive weapon. 
        </p>
            <p>Gambeson</p>
            <p>A gambeson is a padded defensive jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour. 
                Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting that produced a padded cloth.</p>
                <p>Full armour</p>
                <p>Historically acurate plate armour covering most parts of the body. Includes a helmet, chestplate, arm and leg plates and various other pieces usually crafted from steel.</p>
