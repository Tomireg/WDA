<p>Here are some of the most commonly used equipments in Buhurt</p>
<p>Longsword</p>
<p>A longsword is any sword that is generally wielded with two hands. 
    A defining characteristic of the sword isn't the overall length, it's the length of the handle. The hilts (handles) range from 8 to 16 inches long to provide room for gauntleted hands.
    Most long swords were double edged. 
    The design of the sword itself has a very utilitarian feel, the whole sword from the pommel to the tip must be useful in combat. 
    While the designs vary in ornamentation over the 350 years it was used, it carried much of the same look through the period. 
    Longswords were very different than Asian Katana's in many respects. The hilt is longer, there is a cross guard, the overall weight is much heavier and the blades were straight. 
    The only exception to a straight blade was the Flammenschwert or “flame sword” which was a two handed German sword with a wavy blade.</p>
    <p>Shields</p>
    <p>By the simple definition a shield is ” a broad piece of metal or another suitable material, held by straps or a handle attached on one side, used as a protection against blows or missiles. ” 
        Although a medieval shield would fall into any shield used/developed from the 5th to the 15th century. This period of human history saw relatively little growth in terms of technology. 
        So, many of the shields and weapons used did not change a lot over time. 
        In this article, we will focus primarily on European, Germanic and Nordic shields. 
        These had very specific designs and are easily categorized.
        To put it simply, there are three; small, medium and large. 
        This is to say that shields were built for primarily three different reasons. 
        Small shields such as bucklers or hungarian punch shields doubled as weapons. 
        They provided minimal defense and moderate level of additional offense. They had to be used strategically and with a great amount of skill.</p>
        <p>Buckler</p>
        <p>This is a small round shield typically 16 inches or less in diameter that is made exclusively out of metal. 
            It is fairly heavy for its size and provides the user with a moderate level of defense when used correctly and the ability to use the shield as an offensive weapon by striking their opponent with it. 
            A buckler grew in favor for acts of hand to hand combat vs. a grand melee or group type combat.</p>
            <p>Gambeson</p>
            <p>A gambeson is a padded defensive jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour. 
                Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting that produced a padded cloth.</p>
                <p>Full armour</p>
                <p>Historically acurate plate armour covering most parts of the body. Usually crafted from steel.</p>
