            <p>what is Buhurt</p>
            <p>Historical Medieval Battles (HMB) or Buhurt (from Old French b√©hourd: "joust", "tournament") or Armored Combat is a modern full contact fighting sport with steel blunt weapons characteristic for the Middle Ages. Armour and weapons have to follow regulations on historical authenticity and safety published on official Battle of the Nations website. 
                Fighters are covered in full modern produced protective armour, made from steel (or other metal alloy if permitted) made to aesthetically be close to their historical counterparts. This in contrast to Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) that uses modern protective equipment such as a modern fencing helmet, padded fencing jacket, modern padded/heavy duty fencing gloves, forearm and leg protection.
                Hits and blows may be aimed at any parts of the body (with the limitations set in the regulations); both wrestling and percussive techniques are permitted, thrusts are forbidden.
                Unlike staged battles, that can be seen at festivals of historical reenactment of the Middle Ages the competitions in buhurt are the full contact sporting events that are refereed by the referees called knight marshals who have special training and combat experience.</p>
            <p>The History of Buhurt</p>
            <p>Historical medieval battles dates back to the first large-scale battles with the use of steel arms, which were held in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, at times when in the rest of the Eastern European countries reenactors used wooden or textolite weapons. An example is the festival "Zhelezny Grad" (Iron Town) held in Izborsk, where buhurts involving hundreds of fighters took place or Sword of Russia tournament from 1996.
                The first European Championship took place in Ukraine in 2005, with nominations "Sword and Shield", and "Sword vs Sword".
                The expansion of buhurt as a sport truly began after the first held Battle of the Nations in Khotyn Fortress in Ukraine where participants from Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Russia competed under unified rules and regulations. This event attracted participants from the rest of Europe and outside of it and buhurt gained worldwide attention from reenactment community. 
                There is a growing interest in buhurt in the United States. One such organization, Armored Combat League (which split in 2019, creating Armored Combat Worldwide and Armored Combat Sports) was featured in a series called Knight Fight on History Channel.
                Battle of the Nations is held every other year at a new fortress or castle. </p>
