            <p>Historical medieval battle, like any other sport, has several categories. All its categories can be divided into mass and singles.</p>
            <p>Single categories, namely "one vs one" are divided into tournaments and professional fights.</p>
            <p>Points / hits are counted in tournaments known as duels; a fighter must deliver a certain number of blows, commonly 10, to his opponent or gain the maximum number of points within a certain period of time. The tournaments are divided into: </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Categorie</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shield-sword</td>
                    <td>Fighters compete using a shield and sword.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sword-sword</td>
                    <td>Fighters have a one-handed sword and no shield.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sword-buckler</td>
                    <td>Competitors use a sword and a buckler. The first to get 5 hits wins.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Longsword</td>
                    <td>Fighters use longswords.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nonstandard</td>
                    <td>Fighters use weapons that don't fit the other categories: halberd, two-handed ax, two-handed swords, etc.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>There is also a category called "Triathlon": three rounds with different weapons, the first one: "longsword", the second one: "sword-buckler", the third one: "shield-sword." </p>
            <p>Professional fights</p>
            <p>The second "single" HMB category is professional fights. A fight is held in the format of "three rounds of three minutes." According to the rules, any techniques aimed at delivering blows to any part of the body, except for the neck, back of the knee, groin, eyes, feet, and back of the head, if an opponent is bent, are allowed except for thrusts, which are prohibited in all HMB categories. All other things, including 3-second ground fighting with no active movements of the opponents are allowed. </p>
            <p>Mass categories</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 vs 5</li>
                <li>10 vs 10</li>
                <li>12 vs 12</li>
                <li>16 vs 16</li>
                <li>30 vs 30</li>
                <li>Buhurts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rules of mass battles are slightly different. 
            The “kill zones” are the same, but the winner is the one who remains standing on his feet, hits are not counted. In addition to these categories, there are some others, such as the "2 vs 2" which are held in the “deathmatch” mode: several two-member units meet on the lists, the battle is "all against all" and the winner is the two-member unit, of which at least one fighter is on his feet; "10 vs 10" and others. 
            HMB categories often can be created for a specific festival, depending on its objectives and specific requirements of historicity. </p>
            <p>Regulations</p>
            <p>There are unified international rules for the battles. They prohibit a number of very traumatic techniques, as well as regulate the admission of fighters and their weapons in order to observe the historical reliability of equipment, and also to eliminate serious injuries. Due to the fact that different countries used to have different fighting rules, the first unified rules were developed specifically for the world championship on historical medieval battle, "Battle of the Nations." However, the rules used at a local tournament may still differ, for example it may be prohibited to deliver blows to certain areas such as below the knee, or elbow, but the international rating events are conducted in accordance with the accepted international rules for historical medieval battles. Weapons are checked for correct measurements and safety before fighters enter the list. </p>
